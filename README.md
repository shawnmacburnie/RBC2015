## Things you will need to install First

Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

bower-cli: `npm i -g bower`

babel-cli: `npm i -g babel-cli`

I think that is it but there may be more, let me know if you run into errors.

## Install local packages
run the following command in your terminal in the root of this folder

`npm i && bower install`

## Start the Server

`npm start`
